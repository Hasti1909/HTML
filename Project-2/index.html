            <b> What is Web Development?</b>
        </h3>
        Web development is the process of building and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves the
        technical aspects that make a website functional and interactive. While web design focuses on the visual and
        user interface (UI) aspects of a site, web development focuses on the coding and functionality that power the
        site.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are three primary types of web development:

    <h3>

        1. Front-End Development (Client-Side Development)

    </h3>

    <section>
        <div>
            This involves everything that users see and interact with on a website. Front-end developers build the user
            interface (UI) of the site, ensuring it is visually appealing, responsive, and functional. They use
            technologies like:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li><b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</b> The structure of the website; defines elements like headings,
                paragraphs, links, and images.</li>
            <li><b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b> The styling of the website; defines colors, fonts, layout, and other
                design elements.</li>
            <li><b>JavaScript: </b>The scripting language used to make the website interactive and dynamic, like creating
                dropdown menus, sliders, forms, or animations.</li>
            <br>
            Front-end developers need to ensure the website is responsive, meaning it works well on different devices,
            such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
            <h3>
                2. Development (Server-Side Development)

            </h3>
            Back-end development involves building the server-side of a website. It’s responsible for managing and
            storing data, as well as ensuring that the website functions correctly behind the scenes. This includes
            working with:
            <br>

            <P>
              <li>  <b> Server:</b> The hardware or software system that serves the website’s content to users. </li>
            <li> <b> Database:</b> A system for storing and retrieving data, such as user information, posts, or
                products.</li> 
            <li> <b>Server-Side Languages:</b> Programming languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, and Node.js are used
                to interact with databases, manage user authentication, and control the logic of the website.</li>
            <li><b> Frameworks:</b> Tools and libraries like Express (Node.js), Django (Python), and Laravel (PHP) that
                help speed up the back-end development process. </li>
            </P>

            Back-end developers ensure that the server, database, and application interact properly to deliver content
            and functionality to the user.
            <h3>
                3. Full-Stack Development
            </h3>
            Full-stack developers have the skills to work on both the front-end and back-end of a website. They are
            versatile developers capable of handling both the user-facing side (front-end) and the server-side
            (back-end) of the application. Full-stack development requires knowledge of:
            <br>
            <br>
            <li>Front-end technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). </li>
            <li>Back-end technologies (databases, server-side languages).</li>
            <li>Integrating both sides to create a seamless, fully functional website or application.</li>
