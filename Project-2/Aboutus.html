    <h3>
        Key Concepts in Web Development
    </h3>
    <p>
        <li><b>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces): </b>Allow communication between different software components,
            enabling services to exchange data (e.g., integrating a third-party service like Google Maps into a
            website). </li>
        <li><b> Version Control: </b>Tools like Git are used to track changes in code, collaborate with other
            developers, and ensure the codebase remains organized and stable.</li>
        <li><b>Web Hosting:</b> The process of placing the website’s files on a server so that users can access them via
            the internet.</li>
        <li><b>Security:</b> Web development also involves ensuring that websites are secure. Developers implement
            techniques such as SSL certificates, encryption, secure authentication, and protection against threats like
            hacking and malware.</li>
        <li><b>Web Development Frameworks:</b> Pre-built code libraries or templates that help speed up development by
            providing standardized tools and structures. Some examples include:</li>
        <li><b>Front-End Frameworks:</b> React, Angular, Vue.js </li>
        <li><b>Back-End Frameworks:</b> Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails </li>
        <li><b>Content Management Systems (CMS):</b> These are platforms that allow users to build and manage websites
            without needing to write code. Examples include WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal. </li>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Web Development Workflow
    </h3>
    <p>
        <b>1. Planning and Requirements:</b> This phase involves understanding the client’s needs, setting goals for the
        site, and creating a blueprint or wireframe. <br>
        <b>2. Design:</b> The website's visual appearance is created by web designers (typically). <br>
        <b>3. Development:</b> Front-end and back-end developers start coding based on the design and requirements. <br>
        <b> 4. Testing:</b> The website is tested for functionality, security, usability, and performance across
        different devices and browsers. <br>
        <b> 5. Deployment:</b>Once complete, the website is hosted on a server and made publicly available. <br>
        <b>6. Maintenance:</b> Ongoing updates, bug fixes, security patches, and performance improvements are made after
        the website is live. <br>
    </p>
    <h3>
        Conclusion

    </h3>
    Web development is a crucial part of building websites, as it ensures that a site functions properly, interacts with
    users effectively, and integrates with necessary systems (like databases or third-party APIs). Whether working on
    the front-end or back-end (or both), developers use various tools, languages, and frameworks to create dynamic,
    secure, and high-performance websites and web applications.
